# Student-Tracking-System
 
This project help parents and teachers to know the late comers in the campus. The students are provided with a microphone through which they can disclose the reason for being late. The system converts the voice into text data and are then stored in the database. These details are fetched from the database and send as text message to the parents.
This helps to overcome the students laziness to attend the class to increase punctuality among students .

In exixting system,teachers wanted to make a call to parents. On the other side parents are not awared about students absence at campus.
